## About

The simple stopwatch that I made myself in WPF and which I use every day. Made using the MVVM design pattern. Implemented the mechanism to run only one instance of the app. The main buttons are separate user controls with several customizable dependency properties. The stop button has an additional animation in the form of a progress circle, which depends on the time the user presses the button. Also there is a button to dock the application window on top of other windows. Supported keyboard control using keys - Enter, Space and Escape.
